Hi,

First of all i have to apologise for applying for this job twice, i know it's irritating to receive the same application more than once but i hit send without a cover letter!

It sounds like a really great opportunity at a really interesting company. I've been a web developer for nearly 10 years and have a lot of varied experience to bring to a web engineering team. From building apps in PHP for Facebook some years ago at a large social media strategy company to eCommerce in Magento for a small personal client more recently. When working at the various media agencies & brands I'm a person who generally gets along with others and work well in a team, so I often get invited back to work again multiple times.
I've been a freelancer for 5 years now and Javascript's evolution has really inspired me and all the great open source tools that are now available make the development process so much more pleasurabe than in years gone by.

My first job after graduating was working on Apple.com europe and I had the opportunity to visit San Francisco and Cupertino many times and really fell in love with the city, I'm a keen surfer and Ocean beach / Pacifica is where i really learned to surf properly so I've always wanted to relocate there. The idea of being in the heart of the tech industry and being able to easily surf at the weekend is like a dream.
